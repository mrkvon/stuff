# what i travel with

Food is not included in the list. I eat what i find in dumpsters, on the trees around, and if that doesn't work i buy food, too. I tend to buy nuts or sunflower seeds before a hitchhiking stretch (best energy/weight ratio). Food contained in my backpack varies a lot. Generally i don't cook outdoors.
